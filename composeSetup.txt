1. Create account with https://www.compose.com/ ( you get 30 days free trial ). You'll have to give credit card info
2. Create rethinkdb deployment
3. By default, compose sets a password for admin user of rethinkdb. Password will be present in 'Credentials' field in 'Overview'
4. You can remove the password protection from rethinkdb using below command
r.db('rethinkdb').table('users').get('admin').update({"password":false})
You should prefer to use the password in your connect rather then removing the password
5. For ssh tunneling
- enable ssh profile from compose UI ( 4.5$ per month charges) - This will start showing you option of adding a portal user 
- create a user and copy ssh key from your laptop
- This will start showing you SSH Tunnel Configuration in Overview page of compose rethinkdb instance
- Run that command to create a tunnel ( for driver or for admin UI )
Ex: ssh -N compose@aws-us-east-1-portal.31.dblayer.com -p 26755 -L 127.0.0.1:8081:10.204.202.131:8080
ssh -N compose@aws-us-east-1-portal.31.dblayer.com -p 26755 -L 127.0.0.1:28015:10.204.202.131:28015
